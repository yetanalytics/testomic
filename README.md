# testomic

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yetanalytics/testomic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yetanalytics/testomic)

A small library to ease testing with [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) and (optionally) [conformity](https://github.com/rkneufeld/conformity)

## Usage

Testomic provides a dynamic variable `testomic.core/conn` to use in your tests, and a set of macros and utilities to bind/use it.

For a fresh conn that will be automatically released/deleted:

``` clojure
(require '[testomic.core :refer :all])

;; conn is nil by default
(type conn) ;; => nil

(with-conn
  (type conn)) ;; => datomic.peer.LocalConnection

```

For a conn with data transacted in, can bind values like let:

``` clojure
(let-txs [;; first binding/tx
          [[op1 eid1 attr1 val1] :as tx1]
          [[:db/add (d/tempid :db.part/user) :person/name "Bob"]]
          ;; second binding/tx
          [[op2 eid2 attr2 val2] :as tx2]
          [[:db/add (d/tempid :db.part/user) :person/name "Alice"]]]

  ;; accepts multiple transactions
  (d/q '[:find ?name
         :where
         [_ :person/name ?name]]
       (d/db conn)) ;; => #{["Bob"] ["Alice"]}

  ;; resolves-tempids
  (:person/name (d/entity (d/db conn) eid1)) ;; => "Bob"
  (:person/name (d/entity (d/db conn) eid2)) ;; => "Alice"

  ;; will not override a conn if nested!
  (let-txs [tx3 [[:db/add (d/tempid :db.part/user) :person/name "Ethel"]]]
    (d/q '[:find (count ?person) .
           :where
           [?person :person/name]] (d/db conn)) ;; => 3
    ))

```

If fixtures are your thing, you can use `wrap-conn` and `make-wrap-txs-fixture` to reduce code.

### Schema

If you want to provide a schema to be automatically applied to the conn, you can use conformity to do so in a number of different ways:

``` clojure
(set-norms! {:norm/foo ...}) ;; statically set the norms map to be used
(set-norms-path! "test/norms.edn") ;; same, but from file

(with-norms {:norm/foo ...} ;; bind a norms map
  (with-conn ...))

(with-norms-path "test/norms.edn"
  (with-conn ...)) ;; same, from file

;; or use fixtures
(use-fixtures :once (make-wrap-norms-fixture {:norm/foo ...}))
(use-fixtures :once (make-wrap-norms-path-fixture "test/norms.edn"))

```
